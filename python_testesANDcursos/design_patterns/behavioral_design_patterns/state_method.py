Advantages
Open/Closed Principle: We can easily introduce the new states without changing the content of existing states of clientâ€™s code.
Single Responsibility Principle: It helps in organizing the code of particular states into the separate classes which helps in making the code feasible for the other developers too.
Improves Cohesion: It also improves the Cohesion since state-specific behaviors are aggregat    ed into the ConcreteState classes, which are placed in one location in the code.
Disadvantages
Making System complex: If a system has only a few number of states, then its not a good choice to use the State Method as you will end up with adding unnecessary code.
Changing states at run-time: State method is used when we need to change the state at run-time by inputting at different sub-classes, this will be considered as a disadvantage as well because we have a clear separate State classes with some logic and from the other hand the number of classes grows up.
Sub-Classes Dependencies: Here the each state derived class is coupled to its sibling, which directly or indirectly introduces the dependencies between sub-classes.
