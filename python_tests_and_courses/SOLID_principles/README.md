**A concise collection of Python examples showcasing the SOLID principles in action.**  

## üìñ Overview

This folder contains practical code examples that demonstrate the SOLID design principles. The collection also includes a case study: a simplified sale system use case that ties the principles together.

## üèØ File Structure

- **case_use_sale_system.py**  
  A practical use case demonstrating how SOLID principles can be applied in a real-world sale system.

- **dependency_inversion_principle_DIP.py**  
  An example showcasing the Dependency Inversion Principle in Python.

- **interface_segregation_principle_ISP.py**  
  Code that demonstrates the Interface Segregation Principle.

- *(Additional files for other SOLID principles)*  
  Other examples illustrating the remaining SOLID principles such as Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, and Liskov Substitution.

## üóùÔ∏è Key Concepts

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  Keeping classes focused on one task or responsibility.

- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**  
  Designing modules that are open for extension but closed for modification.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**  
  Ensuring that subclass objects can replace superclass objects without affecting functionality.

- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**  
  Splitting large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**  
  Relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
  A class or module should have a single, well-defined responsibility and should not be responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks.

## üìí Reference

A major inspiration and reference for these examples is the article on SOLID principles from [Real Python](https://realpython.com/solid-principles-python/). I highly recommend checking it out for a deeper dive into the theory and best practices.
