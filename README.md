# Course Projects and Code

Welcome to my repository containing code and projects developed while following various YouTube tutorials and courses. This collection reflects my journey as I build my skills and understanding of software development.

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized into several folders, each corresponding to a project or course module:

- **[Design patterns](./python_tests_and_courses/design_patterns/):** Numerous Python design patterns are illustrated through comprehensive code examples, accompanied by detailed explanations and analysis to facilitate a deeper understanding of each concept.
- **[DSA Problems](./python_tests_and_courses/python_data_structures_problems/):** Some code problems solved, in this folder you can find a bunch of problems about DSA and some commom problems.

## Purpose

The projects in this repository are intended to:
- Demonstrate my learning progress and passion for coding.
- Showcase the application of various programming concepts.
- Provide a portfolio of examples that reflect my problem-solving and technical skills.

## How to Use

Each project folder includes its own README with instructions on how to set up and run the code. While the course folders are filled with a bunch of different codes, and in most of the files contains some explanation. If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to open an issue or reach out to me.

## Disclaimer

Some of the code in these projects is based on tutorials from YouTube. They are for educational purposes only. I have made my own improvements and modifications to better understand the concepts and to tailor the projects to my learning style. The courses code I tried to create my own solution before checking the solved answer.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue updating this repository with new projects and improvements as I expand my knowledge in software development. Stay tuned for more updates!
